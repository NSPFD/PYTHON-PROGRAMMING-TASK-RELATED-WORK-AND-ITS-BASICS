        "Dear Students,\n",
        "\n",
        "I hope you are excited about applying your Python skills to a real-world project! For this week's assignment, you will work on a **Tiny Project in Python**. You can choose to create a simple calculator or come up with your own idea for a small Python project. This is a great opportunity to showcase your creativity and programming abilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Project Guidelines\n",
        "1. **Topic**: You have two options:\n",
        "    - **Option 1**: Create a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using kwargs or args\n",
        "    - **Option 2**: Develop a custom project of your choice. It should be small in scope but demonstrate your understanding of Python programming.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Requirements**:\n",
        "    - Your code should be clean, well-commented, and easy to understand.\n",
        "    - If you choose a custom project, ensure it is feasible to complete within a week.\n",
        "    - Make sure to handle any possible errors or exceptions gracefully.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Submission Instructions**:\n",
        "    - **Create a GitHub Repository**: Name it `Tiny Project in Python--<Project Name>`.\n",
        "    - **Upload Your Code**: Push your project files to this repository.\n",
        "    - **Share the Link**: Email the link to your GitHub repository to my email address.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Deadline**: The project must be completed and the link emailed by this week Friday.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Steps to Upload to GitHub\n",
        "1. **Create a GitHub Account**: If you don't already have one, sign up at [GitHub](https://github.com).\n",
        "2. **Create a New Repository**:\n",
        "    - Click the \"+\" icon in the top right corner and select \"New repository\".\n",
        "    - Name your repository `Tiny Project in Python--<Project Name>`.\n",
        "    - Choose whether to make it public or private.\n",
        "    - Initialize with a README (optional).\n",
        "3. **Upload Your Files**:\n",
        "    - Clone your repository to your local machine.\n",
        "    - Add your project files to the repository folder.\n",
        "    - Commit and push your changes to GitHub.\n",
        "4. **Email the Link**: Copy the URL of your repository and send it to my email address.\n",
